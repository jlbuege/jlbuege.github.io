        <p>Hi there!
            <br>
            <br>I'm Jennifer, a Minneapolis-based travel fanatic and amateur photographer. I've created this blog to share photos from and tidbits about my travels, usually with my fellow adventurer-in-arms, cat-lover and boyfriend, Ian. It's also a spot
            where you'll occasionally find posts about recipes I've tried and other forays into the world of food.
            <br>
            <br>In the past few years, I've been fortunate enough to visit a lot of amazing places: Madagascar, the Galápagos Islands, Morocco, Paris, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, Milwaukee, Montreal, Toronto, Dublin, Aruba, Anguilla, Mexico, Alaska
            and Svalbard in the Arctic Circle. Madagascar was mind-blowing and I highly recommend that anyone who loves animals and wants to see lemurs in the wild go now. Road travel there can be tough, but it's worth it!
            <br>
            <br>When not traveling, I'm (hopefully) inspiring others to explore the world in my job as an editor for Delta's inflight magazine, <i>Sky.</i> Every so often, I'll get to write about one of my trips, such as the 10-day expedition through
            the Galápagos in May 2017 or the weeklong Spanish immersion with Fluenz in Mexico City.
            <br>
            <br>Here are a few quick facts about me:
            <br>1. <b>Camera:</b> Nikon D7100, somtimes my <strike>iPhone 6</strike> iPhone 10.
            <br>2. <b>Most Recent Trip:</b> Orlando. First time at Universal Studios Florida and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The weekend before that, it was a decadent stay in The Palm Beaches for work.
            <br>3. <b>Next Trip:</b> Who knows? Botswana is still on the calendar for October, but I'm not placing my bets on anything until we're through this pandemic.
            <br>4. <b>Favorite City:</b> Paris. I mean, c'mon. How can you not love Paris?
            <br>5. <b>Currently Reading:</b> Nothing! I'm hooked on knitting again and that's taking all my free time. That said, I'm also waiting for the next Louise Penny book to come in at the library. When that does, it will completely replace my
            knitting. (Although this sweater with a bit of beading is pretty fun.)
            <br>6. <b>Current Obsessions:</b> See above. Here's <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/people/jbuege">my Ravelry page</a> for anyone who wants to follow along at home, complete with a <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/jbuege/baby-yoda">Baby Yoda pattern</a>.
            Also, I 'm learning Spanish. I have two online tutors, one from <a href="https://fluenz.com/">Fluenz</a>, through which I did an awesome one-week immersion in Mexico City in August, and two others with <a href="http://www.verbling.com">Verbling</a>.
            I also love the apps <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://conjuverb.com/">ConjuVerb</a>.
            <br>7. <b>Travel Wishlist:</b> So hard to narrow down but the top five are South Georgia/the Antarctic, Papua New Guinea, India, Rwanda (round 2) and Hawaii, one of the only states I've never been to. <br>
            <br>Thanks for visiting!</p>
